# Deploy a web application to Heroku that uses Hibernate and Spring MVC

	This repository serves as a good starting point for creating a Java webapp running on Heroku.
	Its primary use is as an example app for a Heroku 101 course.

	Follow instructions below to clone this repository and get your app running on Heroku!
	There is also a section describing how you can use Heroku addons such as Blitz for load testing.

## Clone this repository

	Use for example Git Bash and navigate to a directory where you keep your code.
	For the remainder of this readme, I will assume that you navigate to /c/git (C:/git in Windows).

    :::term
    $ git clone https://github.com/haugene/heroku-hibernate-springmvc-webapp.git
	
	This will create the folder heroku-hibernate-springmvc-webapp.
	Navigate into your new folder.

	:::term
    $ cd heroku-hibernate-springmvc-webapp

## Create a Heroku app where you can deploy your code

    :::term
    $ heroku apps:create
    Creating polar-savannah-7781... done, stack is cedar
    http://polar-savannah-7781.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:polar-savannah-7781.git
    Git remote heroku added

	If you call heroku apps:create <application-name>, heroku will use that name instead of generating a new one.

	As you can see, the command will also add a git remote called "heroku" to your git repository.

## Deploy to Heroku

	To deploy your app to heroku, simply write:

    :::term
    git push heroku master

Congratulations! Your web app should now be up and running on Heroku. Open it in your browser with:

    :::term  
    $ heroku open
	
## Do some load testing on your app

	### Provision the Blitz addon
	
	:::term
    $ heroku addons:add blitz:250
	
	### Open Blitz UI
	
	:::term
    $ heroku addons:open blitz
	
	### Run your load test
	
	Your application has a mapping that accepts a "name" parameter on the overview page.
	The given name will be added to the database.
	
	This allows you to do a simple load test with the following url:
	http://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/web/overview?name=TestName
